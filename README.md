Hi Guys!! I have prepared a chatbot using llama2 and streamlit for the front-end
Procedure to do:
1) Firstly, download ollama(I have used windows) and downloaded the llama2 3.2 GB version.
2) After downloadin it make sure to install and run it in the system.
3) Then move to the command prompt, in which install these packages in it
   pip install langchain_core
   pip install langchain_community
   pip install streamlit
4) After installation, create a python file(eg. ollama.py) and type the code which I have provided.
5) Save the file and open the command prompt, type streamlit run file.py(filename)
